## 📌 What It Does

Every time you open a new tab, you'll see a carefully selected hadith about the Prophet ﷺ — drawn from a curated list based on the famous work *Shama'il al-Muhammadiyah* by Imam al-Tirmidhi.  
Each hadith is shown along with its reference and a link to Sunnah.com for context or further reading.
The displayed Arabic text is also a reminder for the user to send Salawat on our beloved Prophet ﷺ.
_“The closest of people to me on the Day of Resurrection are those who sent the most blessings upon me.” — Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, Sunan al-Tirmidhī 484_

This extension is designed to:
- Foster love for the Prophet ﷺ
- Share authentic knowledge about him ﷺ in a subtle and convenient manner
- Offer a reminder of the best of creation - a breath of fresh air amidst the noise of the internet

## 🤲 Motivation

This extension was created out of a desire to help myself and others learn to increase in love for the Prophet ﷺ and act more like him - in a small, consistent way.
_The Prophet (ﷺ) was asked, "What deeds are loved most by Allah?" He said, "The most regular constant deeds even though they may be few." -Sahih al-Bukhari 6465_
May Allah accept this effort, make it a means of increasing our attachment to His Messenger ﷺ, following in his footsteps, and allow it to be a source of benefit and reward.
