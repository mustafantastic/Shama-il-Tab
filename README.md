## 📌 What It Does

Every time you open a new tab, you'll see a carefully selected hadith about the Prophet ﷺ — drawn from a curated list based on the famous work *Shama'il al-Muhammadiyah* by Imam al-Tirmidhi.  
Each hadith is shown along with its reference and a link to Sunnah.com for context or further reading.
The displayed Arabic text is also a reminder for the user to send Salawat on our beloved Prophet ﷺ.
_“The closest of people to me on the Day of Resurrection are those who sent the most blessings upon me.” — Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, Sunan al-Tirmidhī 484_

This extension is designed to:
- Provide a simple way to foster love for the Prophet ﷺ and learn more about him ﷺ in a subtle and convenient manner
- Offer a reminder of the best of creation - a breath of fresh air amidst the noise of the internet

## 🤲 Motivation

This extension was created out of a desire to help myself and others learn to increase in love for the Prophet ﷺ and act more like him - in a subtle, consistent way.
_The Prophet (ﷺ) was asked, "What deeds are loved most by Allah?" He said, "The most regular constant deeds even though they may be few." -Sahih al-Bukhari 6465_
It is my hope that if we can learn more about his characteristics, we can model them ourselves, and become tools for positive influence to society the way that he ﷺ was.
May Allah accept this effort, make it a means of following the footsteps of and growing in attachment to His Messenger ﷺ, and allow it to be a source of benefit and reward.
